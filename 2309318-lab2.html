                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Abdullah Ali, and I’d like to extend a warm welcome to my webpage. Thank you for taking the time to visit—I truly appreciate it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently a third-year Computer Science student, with a deep passion for coding and problem-solving. Programming excites me, and I’m particularly interested in Data Science. My goal is to leverage my skills to specialize in this field and pursue a career in the financial sector, ideally with a bank, where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making and innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of academics, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that keep me energized and creative. I'm an avid fan of sports, a dedicated gamer, and I love diving into a good book. Spending time with family is one of my greatest joys, and there’s nothing quite like bonding over a good braai or savoring a delicious burger with loved ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking ahead, I am determined to use my degree to make a positive impact on the world. I want to contribute to my community, help others, and create meaningful change wherever I can. As someone from a third-world country, I’m particularly motivated to give back to my nation and contribute to its growth and progress. The versatility of Computer Science offers endless possibilities, and I believe it’s a powerful tool that can address many of the challenges we face in society today.

                <h3>Latest Project</h3>
                <p>
                    While I haven’t had the chance to work on many side projects so far, I’ve mainly focused on completing my studies. However, this year, the structure of my course has shifted, and we’re expected to take a more self-directed approach to learning. This includes mastering key technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on our own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that any additional language or technology I practice on the side will only enhance my skills and understanding. With that in mind, I’ve set a clear objective for myself this year: to truly master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development. On top of that, I’m also diving into Python, particularly for machine learning applications, as I want to apply these skills to real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside web development and machine learning, I’m aiming to expand my skillset further by learning React.js, which will be a valuable addition to my front-end development toolkit. Additionally, I’ve set my sights on becoming proficient with design tools like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, as I want to have a well-rounded set of skills that will allow me to build both functional and visually appealing websites.
