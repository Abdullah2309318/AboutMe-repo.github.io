# AboutMe-repo.github.io

Hi, My name is Abdullah Ali from the University of Witwatstrand. I am studying a BSc in Computer Science.

This is my first lab. It is a basic lab where I will work with Git and GitHub, manage branches, document my work through commit messages, and deploy a simple web page to GitHub Pages. I am required to create a repository, make multiple commits, manage branches, and deploy an HTML file according to the specifications provided. To do this, I will create and deploy a simple HTML page about myself to GitHub pages.
